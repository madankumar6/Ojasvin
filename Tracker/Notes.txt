Token Based Authendication
	The work flow is like this.
		If the token is not valid or doesn't exist on the client, the user gets redirected to the log-in route
		The user enters his credentials and presses the log-in button
		The date gets posted to the server where a special middle-ware handles that request
		The user gets authenticated on the server side
		The token, including a validation date and some meta date, gets created
		The token gets returned back to the client
		the client stores the token in the local storage, cookie or whatever, to use it on every new request.
